PyTorch-based Neural Graph Fingerprint for Organic Molecule Representations

# Keras Neural Graph Fingerprint

This repository is an implementation of [Convolutional Networks on Graphs for Learning Molecular Fingerprints][NGF-paper] in Keras.

It includes a preprocessing function to convert molecules in smiles representation
into molecule tensors.

## Related work

There are several implementations of this paper publicly available:
 - by [HIPS][1] using autograd
 - by [debbiemarkslab][2] using theano
 - by [GUR9000] [3] using keras
 - by [ericmjl][4] using autograd
 - by [DeepChem][5] using tensorflow
 - by [keiserlab][6] using Keras

The closest implementation is the implementation by GUR9000 and keiserlab in Keras. However this
repository represents moleculs in a fundamentally different way. The consequences
are described in the sections below.

## Molecule Representation

### Atom, bond and edge tensors
This codebase uses tensor matrices to represent molecules. Each molecule is
described by a combination of the following three tensors:

   - **atom matrix**, size: `(max_atoms, num_atom_features)`
   	 This matrix defines the atom features.

     Each column in the atom matrix represents the feature vector for the atom at
     the index of that column.

   - **edge matrix**, size: `(max_atoms, max_degree)`
     This matrix defines the connectivity between atoms.

     Each column in the edge matrix represent the neighbours of an atom. The
     neighbours are encoded by an integer representing the index of their feature
     vector in the atom matrix.

     As atoms can have a variable number of neighbours, not all rows will have a
     neighbour index defined. These entries are filled with the masking value of
     `-1`. (This explicit edge matrix masking value is important for the layers
     to work)

   - **bond tensor** size: `(max_atoms, max_degree, num_bond_features)`
   	 This matrix defines the atom features.

   	 The first two dimensions of this tensor represent the bonds defined in the
   	 edge tensor. The column in the bond tensor at the position of the bond index
   	 in the edge tensor defines the features of that bond.

   	 Bonds that are unused are masked with 0 vectors.


### Batch representations

 This codes deals with molecules in batches. An extra dimension is added to all
 of the three tensors at the first index. Their respective sizes become:

 - **atom matrix**, size: `(num_molecules, max_atoms, num_atom_features)`
 - **edge matrix**, size: `(num_molecules, max_atoms, max_degree)`
 - **bond tensor** size: `(num_molecules, max_atoms, max_degree, num_bond_features)`

As molecules have different numbers of atoms, max_atoms needs to be defined for
the entire dataset. Unused atom columns are masked by 0 vectors.

### Strong and weak points
The obvious downside of this representation is that there is a lot of masking,
resulting in a waste of computation power.

The alternative is to represent the entire dataset as a bag of atoms as in the
authors [original implementation](https://github.com/HIPS/neural-fingerprint). For
larger datasets, this is infeasable. In [keiserlab's implementation] (https://github.com/keiserlab/keras-neural-graph-fingerprint)
the same approach is used, but each batch is pre-calculated as a bag of atoms.
The downside of this is that each epoch uses the exact same composition of batches,
decreasing the stochasticity. Furthermore, Keras recognises the variability in batch-
size and will not run. In his implementation GUR9000 included a modified version
of Keras to correct for this.

The tensor representation used in this repository does not have these downsides,
and allows for many modificiations of Duvenauds algorithm (there is a lot to explore).

## NeuralGraph layers
The two workhorses are defined in [models/layers.py](NGF/layers.py).

`NeuralGraphHidden` takes a set of molecules (represented by `[atoms, bonds, edges]`),
and returns the convolved feature vectors of the higher layers. Only the feature
vectors change at each iteration, so for higher layers only the `atom` tensor needs
to be replaced by the convolved output of the previous `NeuralGraphHidden`.

`NeuralGraphOutput` takes a set of molecules (represented by `[atoms, bonds, edges]`),
and returns the fingerprint output for that layer. According to the [original paper][NGF-paper],
the fingerprints of all layers need to be summed. But these are neural nets, so
feel free to play around with the architectures!

### Initialisation
The NeuralGraph layers have an internal (`Dense`) layer of the output size
(`conv_width` for `NeuralGraphHidden` or `fp_length` for `NeuralGraphOutput`).
This inner layer accounts for the trainable parameters, activation function, etc.

There are three ways to initialise the inner layer and it's parameters:

1. Using an integer `conv_width` and possible kwags (`Dense` layer is used)
  ```python
  atoms1 = NeuralGraphHidden(conv_width, activation='relu', bias=False)([atoms0, bonds, edges])
  ```

2. Using an initialised `Dense` layer
  ```python
  atoms1 = NeuralGraphHidden(Dense(conv_width, activation='relu', bias=False))([atoms0, bonds, edges])
  ```

3. Using a function that returns an initialised `Dense` layer
  ```python
  atoms1 = NeuralGraphHidden(lambda: Dense(conv_width, activation='relu', bias=False))([atoms0, bonds, edges])
  ```

In the case of `NeuralGraphOutput`, all these three methods would be identical.
For `NeuralGraphHidden`, these methods are equal, but can be slightly different.
The reason is that a `NeuralGraphHidden` has a dense layer for each `degree`.

The following will not work for `NeuralGraphHidden`:
```python
atoms1 = NeuralGraphHidden(conv_width, activation='relu', bias=False, W_regularizer=l2(0.01))([atoms0, bonds, edges])
```

The reason is that the same `l2` object will be passed to each internal layer,
wheras an `l2` object can obly be assigned to one layer.

Method 2. will work, because a new layer is instanciated based on the configuration
of the passed layer.

Method 3. will work if a function is provided that returns a new `l2` object each
time it is called (as would be the case for the given lambda function).


## NeuralGraph models
For convienience, two builder functions are included that can build a variety
of Neural Graph models by specifiying it's parameters. See [NGF/models.py](NGF/models.py).

The examples in [examples.py](examples.py) should help you along the way.
NGF
You can store and load the trained models. Make sure to specify the custom classes:
```python
model = load_model('model.h5', custom_objects={'NeuralGraphHidden':NeuralGraphHidden, 'NeuralGraphOutput':NeuralGraphOutput})
```

## Dependencies
- [**RDKit**](http://www.rdkit.org/) This dependency is nescecairy to convert molecules into tensor
representatins, once this step is conducted, the new data can be stored, and RDkit
is no longer a dependency.
- [**PyTorch**](https://PyTorch.org/) Requires PyTorch 1.0 for building, training and evaluating the models.
- [**NumPy**](http://www.numpy.org/)
